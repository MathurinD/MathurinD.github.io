I am a bioinformatician trained in both molecular and cellular biology and bioinformatics.
My main interest is systems biology, or how to reconstruct the inner working of a significant part of a cell by applying a large set of perturbations.
To solve those problems I have acquired significant experience in the design, generation and analysis of drug screens, dropout screens, multiplexed protein measurements and single cell RNAseq.

For my PhD thesis I modelled the MAPK and PI3K pathways in neuroblastoma to suggest new targeted therapy and overcome resistance to existing ones (<a href="files/Dorel_PhD_thesis.pdf">manuscript</a>, <a href="files/Dorel_PhD_defense.pdf">slides</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MathurinD/PhDThesis">LaTeX</a>).

When not doing science, I am a decent Rock 4 temps and Batchata dancer, and an adept of <a href="hiking">long hikes</a>.
