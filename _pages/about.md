I am a bioinformatician trained in both molecular and cellular biology and bioinformatics.
My main interest is systems biology, or how to reconstruct the inner working of a significant part of a cell by applying a large set of perturbations.
To solve those problems I have acquired significant experience in the design, generation and analysis of drug screens, dropout screens, multiplexed protein measurements and single cell RNAseq.

For my PhD thesis I modelled the MAPK and PI3K pathways in neuroblastoma to suggest new targeted therapy and overcome resistance to existing ones (<a href="files/Dorel_PhD_thesis.pdf">manuscript</a>, <a href="files/Dorel_PhD_defense.pdf">slides</a>, <a href="https://github.com/MathurinD/PhDThesis">LaTeX</a>).

When not doing science, I am a decent Rock 4 temps and Batchata dancer, and an adept of <a href="hiking">long hikes</a>.

I like designing complex experiments and made a series of posts in collaboration with FÃ©lix Raimundo and others to help non-biologist get an idea of the cost of standard biology experiments:

1bis. [Knock-out cell line generation](posts/2025/09/single_ko_generation/)
2. [RNAseq](posts/2025/09/short-read-rnaseq/)
2bis. [Long read RNA sequencing](posts/2025/09/long-read-rnaseq/)
3. [Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)](posts/2025/09/whole-genome-sequencing)
3bis. [Long read WGS](posts/2025/09/long-read-genome-sequencing/)
10. [CRISPR screen](posts/2025/09/crispr_ko_screens/)
