## Why do you do this experiment?

Sequencing RNA enables the identification and quantification of RNA expressed in a cell or a sample (the transcriptome).

**Input** Live cells, FFPE, frozen cells or RNA

**Output** Fastq file (20-100M PE reads) -> Gene expression

## Strategic Value

By comparing multiple samples, we know the effect of perturbations (drug, disease, [knock-out](/2025-09-02-single-ko.md), etc) on the transcriptome of the cell. This can be used to understand gene regulation, how a drug works, or which processes a disease affects.

## Cost & Scale

- Variable per run: **\\$150/sample**. Range: \\$118 - \\$236
- Cost breakdown:
    + RNA extraction: \\$56
    + Short read library preparation: \\$50
    + Sequencing (20-100M reads, 4-30Gb): \\$12-\\$120
- Capex: Thermocycler (\\$10-20k), TapeStation (\\$6-30k), NGS Sequencer (\\$50k-1M)

## Experimental Modules

1. RNA extraction (2h30, 40' hands-on)
2. Sequencing library preparation (6h, 2h hands-on)
3. Sequencing run (4-24h depending on the sequencer)

## Ops & Throughput

**Turnaround**: 3+ days (day 1 extraction, day 2 library prep, day 3 or later sequencing)

**Hands-on time**: 4h

**Parallelizability**: High. All steps can be done in parallel for as many samples as needed.

**Bottlenecks**: availability of Tapestation (16 lanes) and thermocycler (96 wells).

**Batching**: 1 to 16 samples per technician.

**Automation readiness**: Full, with commercial solutions available.

**Outsourceability**: Yes.

**Data scale**: 20-100M reads/sample, ~30Gb/sample

## Pitfalls & Failure Modes

- Don't skip the ribo-depletion or polyA enrichment step, they represent most of the extration cost but are there for a reason. [>90%](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/127231/fgene-06-00002-HTML/image_m/fgene-06-00002-t001.jpg)[^1] of RNA in a cell are rRNA or tRNA. Sequencing total RNA from a cell without size selection with short read sequencing would yield around 70% of rRNA reads and 15% of tRNA reads which are not very interesting populations (unless you look at base modifications, which is not done in short read). With the cheap cost of sequencing nowdays you should systematically go for ribo-depletion over polyA. Batch correction can integrate your ribo-depleted data with a polyA cohorts without problems.
- Most protocols for RNAseq are optimized for the extraction of RNA longer than 20bp and will size select the sequencing library to 300-500bp. This will exclude small RNA populations (tRNA, miRNA, snoRNA, etc). If you are interested in those populations use dedicated kit (e.g [Qiagen miRNAeasy](https://www.qiagen.com/us/product-categories/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/mirna)) and remove the size selection steps.

## Order list

Plenty of suppliers exist for this kind of protocol and you can mostly mix an match suppliers to your liking for each step. I used NEB as a convenient example as their documentation is quite clear.
