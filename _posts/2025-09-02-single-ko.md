## Why do you do this experiment?

Knocking-out genes in cell lines deactivates one or more gene in one or more cell lines to study the function of the gene.

## Strategic Value

Unlocks functional knowledge of the role of a target gene (via various experiments performed on the generated cell line)

## Cost & Scale

- Variable per run: **\\$200/run**. Range: \\$100 (cheap cell lines + plasmid in house) - \\$3000 (expensive cell line + order everything)
- Cost breakdown:
    + Cells: \\$0-\\$1700
    + Transfection and cell culture: \\$100-1100
    + Cas9 system : \\$50
    + Knock-out validation: \\$50
- Capex: BSL1 cell culture, BSL1 lab

## Experimental Modules

1. Procure cell lines and procure/generate a CRISPR plasmid (1 week - 4 weeks, 6h - 24h hands-on)
2. Transduce the cells (48h - 2 weeks, 2h - 12h hands-on)
3. Validate the knock-out(s) (48h, 8h hands-on)

## Ops & Throughput

**Turnaround**: 11 days - 44 days (cell culture dominates)

**Hands-on time**: 16h - 44h

**Parallelizability** Medium, multiple knock-outs in multiple cell lines can be done in parallel. All steps bottleneck at about the same rate with the number of samples to handle.

**Batching** 1 to 12 recommended to keep cells passaging manageable.

**Automation readiness**  [manual vs partial vs full automation]

**Outsourceability** Yes, e.g [AcroBiosystem](https://www.acrobiosystems.com/A2746-Gene-knockout-Cell-Lines.html), [Cyagen](https://www.cyagen.com/custom-cell-line-models/knockout-cell-lines), [iXCells](https://ixcellsbiotech.com/preclinical-cro-services/genome-editing/), [Runtogen](https://www.runtogen.com/category/gene-editing-cell-lines/knockout-cell-lines/), [Abcam](https://www.abcam.com/en-us/technical-resources/product-overview/knockout-cell-lines?srsltid=AfmBOorPQ4cKD8fp18pjFR53cCc8cNlZgZy_gxwGW7-093WOpdiNtrcG).

## Pitfalls & Failure Modes

- <u>Monoclonal vs polycloncal decision</u>: Polyclonal populations are fast to produce but can drift, monoclonal are more consistent but with a strong clonal effect so everything must be validated in several clones.
- You can produce a clean knock-out of large size (up to 1Mb) with paired (or more to increase efficiency) sgRNAs targeting a genomic region in two places. The simultaneous cut by Cas9 creates a separate DNA fragment that is unlikely to be ligated by the DNA repair machinery. See [Song2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5351561/) for more details.

## Protocol variations

- Modified Cas enzyme to induce silencing (CRISPRi), activation (CRISPRa), edit single nucleotides (CRISPR editing), knock-down (Cas13). Those must be transduced (with virus in BSL2 labs) and can be inducible (for time series).
